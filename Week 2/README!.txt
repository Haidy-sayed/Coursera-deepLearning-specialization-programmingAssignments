This is week2 assignment from the deep learning specialization at coursera, I ran the tests on Coursera's notebook as the test samples and data are there, so the code if tried to run on your PC might not work properly , yet provided screenshots of the results and the code could be tested on any dataset of images as it's generic.

-->the learning rate and number of iterations are chosen manually -till now-
-->you can manually tesyt on any images you'd like


Thanks.
Haidy.
